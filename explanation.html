      <h1>The Barnum effect is why horoscopes and palm reading work</h1>

      <p>If you just felt, that the results of your "test" were accurate, that is due
        to the so-called Barnum effect. Named after P. T. Barnum, a showman of the 19th
        century, the effect was originally referred to the "fallacy of personal
        validation" by its discoverer Bertram Forer.</p>

      <p>The Barnum effect works because of a number of factors, e.g.:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The statements are vague, so everybody can read their own meaning into
          them. </li>
        <li>The statements are mainly positive.</li>
        <li>The subject trusts in the authority of the person giving the statements.</li>
        <li>The subject believes that the statements are tailored specifically to
          them.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Modifiers like "sometimes" or "at times" are used, to make the statements
        even more vague.</p>
      
      <p>The Barnum effect is used in all sorts of future-telling, like horoscopes and
        a technique called "cold reading". It is a special case of confirmation bias,
        which simply put is the psychological bias that lets you only see evidence
        that confirms what you want to believe and disregard counterevidence. Since
        Barnum statements are mainly positive and generally very vague, it is easy
        wanting to believe them (who wouldn't want to believe that they're a good
        person?) and it is also easy to apply one's own meaning and interpretation to
        them. </p>

      <p>In marketing, the Barnum effect is often used to draw people in. With small
        statements like "just for you", or "to show your colourful personality to the
        world", companies appeal to their customers' wish of being seen as special and
        the inherent feeling of being the protagonist in one's own story. </p>

      <h3>How to avoid falling for this technique</h3>

      <p>You're actually working on it right now. Even knowing about the existence of
        the Barnum effect helps reduce its impact. It further helps to be mindful of
        the wording of people who are trying to sell something to you or trying to
        influence you. If you stay sceptical and ask yourself: "Does this apply only to
        me or would it apply to most people?", you are on the right path. </p>
