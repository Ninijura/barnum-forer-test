      <h1>Barnum-Forer Personality Test</h1>
      <p>The Barnum-Forer Personality Test is based upon modern knowledge about the human
        psyche. The technique we use is shown to give reliable results, as participants
        conistently rate the accuracy of the results above 80%.<a href="http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Forer_The%20fallacy%20of%20personal%20validation_1949.pdf">[1]</a> </p>

      <p>This setup is part of an ongoing research project, combining our knowledge about
        the Barnum-Forer Personality Test with knowledge about how personality influences
        different physiological values. </p>

      <p>In order to participate in the study, please place your hand on the apparatus to
        the right and then click on the "Start scan" button below. The system will proceed
        to measure factors like the conductivity of your skin and the pressure you apply to
        the surface. Based on this, we will calculate your results.</p>

      <p>Please take a moment after receiving your results to provide us with feedback on
        the accuracy of the test. This is important for our research.</p>
